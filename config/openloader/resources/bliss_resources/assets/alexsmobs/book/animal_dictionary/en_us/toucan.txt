Toucans are colorful little birds with massive beaks. They can often be found on trees in jungle biomes. Toucans come in a variety of dazzling colors.

These passive birds have a serious affinity for apples. When fed an apple, there is a chance for a toucan to place an oak sapling somewhere in the world with its beak.

When fed a golden apple, a toucan will momentarily transform into a golden toucan, and plant saplings at a much faster rate. Feeding a toucan an Enchanted Golden Apple results in a toucan that does not need to constantly be fed fruits in order to place saplings. Toucans can be bred with eggs.
